  - how do AI planes decide what to do?
    - target player
      - targetting the controlled entity
      - change pitch to point at it
      - flip when upside down
  - add in procedurally-generated clouds?
  - zoom out when you speed up and zoom in when you slow down?


- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -
  - shooting
    - bullets just can't travel very fast because of limit of not skipping squares
    - holding spacebar doesn't consistently shoot
  - jet not colliding with obstacles any more
    - because they're not checking for canDoMove any more
  - make viewPos tracking smoother
  - allow bigger grids
    - don't initialize entities: [] in all grid squares
  - sometimes wasd stops working to control the screen!


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - player-controllable jet
    - tune controls
      - jet is still too fast so it doesn't visibly slow

  - add enemy planes
  - figure out world sizing and viewport
  - ability to fire missiles
  - HUDs
    - thrust and airspeed
    - ammo amount

  - art
    - Sabre + MiG
    - jet sprites
      - side view
      - tilt view
      - shooting
      - on fire
      - exploding
